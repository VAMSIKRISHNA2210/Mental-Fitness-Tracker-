# Mental Health Fitness Tracker
ML model that utilizes regression techniques to provide insights into mental health and make predictions based on the available data.
# SUMMARY
1. Developed a fully functional Mental Health Fitness Tracker ML model using Python and scikit-learn.
2. Utilized 12 types of regression algorithms to achieve precise results in analyzing and predicting mental fitness levels from over 150 countries.
3. Cleaned, preprocessed, and engineered features to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.
4. Optimized the model's performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters and implementing ensemble methods, resulting in an impressive accuracy percentage of 98.50%.
# REFRENCES
